This repository is being used to house the html and css files for my first project.

I have created 2 versions of the same website. I have chosen to take a better approach with this later version, using SCSS and HTML to simplify the design and improve readability. The following project is in regards to a semi make-believe stargazing sanctuary in NSW. Destination Lost is a combination of places inspired from Patagonia, Blue Mountains and Iceland.
